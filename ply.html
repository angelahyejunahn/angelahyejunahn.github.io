					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Overview</h2>
					<p>It is a common workflow for an <span class="lookup-word">FEA</span> engineer to apply a <span class="lookup-word">ply</span> or a specific combination of <span class="lookup-word">plies</span> to multiple regions of a model. Apex supports definition and application of individual <span class="lookup-word">plies</span>, however the user cannot reuse them to apply to different regions.</p>
					<p>The Sheet Stack catalog enhances the current Apex composite capabilities by adding support for definition of named <span class="lookup-word">ply packs</span>, which are specific combination of <span class="lookup-word">plies</span>, as well as application of these <span class="lookup-word">ply packs</span> to multiple regions of the model.</p>
					<p>This capability greatly improves the usability and throughput of users who are defining composite structures.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="Problem" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Problem</h2>
					<p>Apex supports definition of <span class="lookup-word">composite layups</span>. However, a limitation of the current implementation is that each <span class="lookup-word">ply</span> must be manually defined, and it cannot be reused. In practice, it is common for a specific combination of <span class="lookup-word">plies</span>, which we refer to here as a ‘<span class="lookup-word">ply pack</span>’, to be used in multiple regions of a model.</p>
					<p>The lack of this capability causes users to spend a lot of time defining and re-defining the same <span class="lookup-word">plies</span>, which makes the <span class="lookup-word">composite layup</span> building process inefficient and error-prone.</p>

					<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/4.png" title="Sheet catalog UI" alt="Sheet catalog UI inside Apex"/>
					<p>The solution we decided to implement gives users the ability to create a catalog of reusable <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> and <span class="lookup-word">stacks</span>, which can be used to build <span class="lookup-word">composite layups</span>.</p>
					<p>This will significantly reduce the time users spend building a <span class="lookup-word">composite layup</span> by removing the duplicate work. It will also reduce errors that might arise from manually building each <span class="lookup-word">ply</span> and <span class="lookup-word">ply pack</span> in the <span class="lookup-word">composite layup</span> and ensure consistency across different <span class="lookup-word">composite layups</span>.</p>

						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">Overview of Sheet Stack catalog design</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/5.png" alt="Sheet Stack UI Panel"/>
						<ol class="detail-section-ol">
							<li>There are two catalogs supported in this tool panel. First is the Materials catalog, which already exists in the application, and second is the new Sheet Stack catalog. To define a <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span>, the user must define its material. For this reason, the two catalogs are placed within the same panel.</li>
							<li>The user can import and export <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span>/<span class="lookup-word">stack</span> properties in a MatML file, which is an extensible markup language (XML) developed especially for the interchange of materials information.<br>Note: A composite material is a combination of two materials with different physical and chemical properties.</li>
							<li>The user can sort the <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> and <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> lists by the added date, alphabetically, or reverse-alphabetically. In the future, if there is a need to support independent sorting for each list, we can enhance this feature.</li>
							<li>The user can search for a specific <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> or <span class="lookup-word">stack</span>.</li>
							<li>The user can click the button to create a <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> or <span class="lookup-word">stack</span>.</li>
							<li>This is the list of <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> in the catalog. This list appears above the <span class="lookup-word">stacks</span> list because the user first creates <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> and uses them to build <span class="lookup-word">stacks</span>. A <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> alone does not have properties - it is simply an ordered group of <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span>.</li>
							<li>This is the list of <span class="lookup-word">stacks</span> in the catalog.</li>
							<li>This section displays the properties of the selected <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> or <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> in the list. The user can edit properties in this section.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Below are some of the key features in the design that address the driving use cases of this project.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 1 - Create reusable sheets and stacks in the catalog</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/6.png" alt="New sheet UI"/>
						<p>A <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> is defined by a material and a thickness. In Apex, materials are defined in the Materials catalog. This is the reason that the design evolved to include both catalogs in a single tool panel instead of having two separate panels.</p>
						<p>When creating a new <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span>, the user can modify its name, select a material from the Materials catalog (all of the materials in the catalog are listed in the dropdown), and define the thickness.</p>
						<br><br>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/7.png" alt="New stack UI"/>
						<p>A <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> is defined by one or more <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span>. In the real world, an engineer builds a <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> of <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> by laying one <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> at a time on a flat surface. This UI resembles that workflow -- as the user adds a <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> to the <span class="lookup-word">stack</span>, the datagrid will display the first <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> at the bottom and the last <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> at the top.</p>
						<p>For each row in the datagrid, the user can select a <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span> from the dropdown, which displays the list of available <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span>. The material and thickness information comes from the <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span>, so they’re greyed out.</p>
						<p>For each row in the datagrid, the user can define the angle at which to lay the <span class="lookup-word">sheet</span>.</p>
						<p>Unlike in the real world, the user can easily change the order of <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> in a <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> by dragging/dropping a row. This allows users to easily modify the order, which makes the building process convenient for the user.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 2 - Create symmetric stacks</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/8.png" alt="Symmetric even stack UI"/>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/ply/9.png" alt="Symmetric odd stack UI"/>
						<p>It is very common for engineers to build symmetric <span class="lookup-word">stacks</span>. Rather than manually building a symmetric <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> by adding <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> symmetrically, the user can check the ‘symmetric’ checkbox, which causes the system to automatically copy and paste <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> (in the reverse order). The user can define whether the symmetric <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> has an even or odd number of <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span>, and based on the selection, the datagrid will automatically update.</p>
						<p>A symmetry line (dotted blue line) will be displayed when a <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> is marked symmetric. This allows the user to easily determine whether the symmetry is built correctly.</p>
						<p>If the order of the <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> is incorrect, then the user can easily drag and drop the datagrid row, and the order of the rest of the <span class="lookup-word">sheets</span> will be adjusted to ensure that the <span class="lookup-word">stack</span> remains symmetric.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section id="Reflection" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Reflection</h2>
					<p>During the research phase of this project, I reached out to the field experts to understand the use cases and get feedback on the initial designs. I learned a lot about what the different terms meant in the physical world as well as the workflow of creating <span class="lookup-word">composite layups</span>. This was immensely helpful because I was able to think about what the user would do in each step of the workflow and identify areas of improvement. For example, in the initial designs, I did not include the Materials catalog and Sheet Stack catalog in the same panel. But in the final version, I modified the design such that they are displayed within the same panel -- this would better support the workflow of an engineer who is going through the entire process of creating a <span class="lookup-word">composite layup</span>. When I went back to the field experts to get feedback on this design, they agreed that this aligns with the overall workflow and that it helps the users discover the new catalog, since the Materials catalog is a very frequently used tool in the application.</p>
