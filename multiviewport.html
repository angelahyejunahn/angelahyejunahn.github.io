					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Overview</h2>
					<p>It is a common workflow of an <span class="lookup-word">FEA</span> engineer to simultaneously examine and analyze multiple simulation results, which arise from different simulation settings. This allows her to be able to compare results, spot anomalies, and identify the most optimal settings for the simulation.</p>
					<p>The multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> capability in Apex enables aerospace and automotive engineers to create multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> with different <span class="lookup-word">result plots</span> across multiple simulation scenarios, allowing them to compare and analyze data efficiently and easily.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="Problem" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Problem</h2>
					<p>Apex’s single <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> was not sufficient for engineers to compare different <span class="lookup-word">load cases</span> and simulation <span class="lookup-word">result plots</span>. In order to work around this, the user had to frequently toggle the visible <span class="lookup-word">load case</span> and simulation <span class="lookup-word">result plot</span> in a single <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>, which was inefficient and made comparing detailed data almost impossible.</p>

				<section id="DrivingUseCases" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Driving Use Cases</h2>
					<p>Based on the initial meetings with Honda, I identified the following driving use cases for this project: </p>
					<ol class="detail-section-ol">
						<li>Compare load quantity time histories from multiple interface points arising from multiple <span class="lookup-word">events</span> in a single XY Chart.</li>
						<li>Compare load quantity time histories from multiple interface points arising from a single or multiple <span class="lookup-word">events</span> in multiple XY Charts alongside a 3D State Plot displaying a transient animation of the full system. At a given time, compare up to 9 different plots or charts.</li>
						<li>Visualize time based synchronization between State Plots and XY Charts.</li>
						<li>Change the active <span class="lookup-word">event</span> in a view and observe all <span class="lookup-word">coupled</span> <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> update.</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section id="Brainstorming" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Brainstorming</h2>
					<p>Many FEA softwares already provided the ability to create multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>. I looked at some MSC products as well as our competitors.</p>
					<p>The Model Browser (see image below) displays detailed information about the model in the 3D graphics <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>. When extending Apex to support multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>, each <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> must have its own Model Browser since what is displayed in each <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> can be different. So I came up with the idea of an ‘active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>’. When a <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> is active, the Model Browser on the lefthand side would display the information about the model, <span class="lookup-word">result plot</span>, etc. that is in the active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>. This prevents the UI from becoming more complex, and it helps the user focus on one <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> at a time.</p>
					<p>This idea of an ‘active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>’ played nicely with the rest of the UI. For example, instead of displaying the ODM (Object Display Manipulator) in each 3D graphics <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>, I would be able to display a single ODM, which corresponds to the active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</p>
					<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/1.png" alt="UI for ODM annd Model Browser" />
					<p>There were two ideas about how the user would create a new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>. In <span class="lookup-word">post-processing</span>, there is an implementation limitation, where a <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> cannot be empty (i.e. must display a <span class="lookup-word">result plot</span>).</p>
					<p><strong>Option 1:</strong><br>User creates a new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> by clicking an "Add new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>" button. For example, if there are 2 <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>, and the user wants to create a third one, then the user would click the button, which would change the layout from 2-up to 3-up.</p>
					<p>Although the idea of creating a <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> by clicking a button sounded like a good idea, it was not clear what the new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> would display. Would it display the same <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> as the last <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>? Or would it display the same <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> as the active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>?</p>
					<p>When I discussed this with different customers and field experts, the opinion was split - some said it should display what was in the last <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>, whereas others said it should display what was in the active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</p>
					<p><strong>Option 2:</strong><br>User identifies upfront what <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> to display in the new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</p>
					<p>In the Model Browser, the user defines the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> by selecting the corresponding row, right-clicking, and selecting the "Display in new Viewport" option. Since this information is defined upfront, when the new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> gets created, it knows what to display.</p>
					<p>Although this is not as discoverable as Option 1, it works around the implementation limitation of not being able to display empty <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>, and our users are also very familiar with using right-click context menus for various common operations.</p>
					<p>Option 2 aligned better with Honda’s workflow, and it was suitable for the minimum viable solution, so I went with this option. I discussed plans to make the <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> creation workflow more discoverable, and it has been scheduled for a future release.</p>

				<section id="UIDesign" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">UI Design</h2>
					<p>I try to create high-fidelity mockups and clickable prototypes pretty early in my design phase because:</p>
					<ol class="detail-section-ol">
						<li>It helps to clearly communicate the design ideas with customers and other stakeholders. I noticed that the audience struggles to understand the design ideas or loses focus when designers use low-fidelity mockups or sketches.</li>
						<li>Apex has a list of design paradigms and patterns that all of the designers try to adhere to.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Below are some of the high-fidelity mockups that I used during meetings with Honda to demonstrate what multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> capability would look like in Apex.</p>

				<section id="ClickablePrototype" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Clickable Prototype</h2>
					<p>Next, I created clickable prototype to demonstrate how the multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> capability in Apex can support Honda’s use cases and workflow.</p>
					<p>I iterated on the design and the prototype based on the feedback from Honda. These were some of their feedback:</p>
					<ul class="detail-section-list">
						<li>In complex models, they need the ability to view more than 400 different <span class="lookup-word">result plots</span> and charts.</li>
						<li>They need the ability to focus on a single plot or chart.</li>
						<li>Given that <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> cannot be moved around (this was due to our resource limitation that we identified prior to our initial meeting with Honda), they want the ability to toggle between 3D graphics mode and XY Chart mode within a single <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</li>
						<li>They want to be able to change the <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> layout based on the model shape and the curve shape in the chart.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>After many iteration, we were able to come to an agreement on the final design.</p>

				<section id="Solution" class="detail-section">
					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Solution</h2>
					<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/8.png" title="Multiple viewport design" alt="Multiple viewport design"/>
					<p>The solution we decided to implement gives users the ability to create multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> in <span class="lookup-word">post-processing</span>, where the user can view and compare multiple <span class="lookup-word">result data</span>. Each <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> will support either a 3D graphics view, which is useful for viewing the model and <span class="lookup-word">result plots</span>, or an XY chart view, which is useful for spotting oddities based on the shape of the graph.</p>
					<p>User can play synchronous animations across multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> and observe how the model in the 3D graphics <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> behaves at peaks and valleys in the XY chart <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</p>
					<p>Below are some of the key features in the design that address the driving use cases and Honda’s feedback.</p>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 1 - Add curves from multiple events in a single XY Chart</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/9.png" alt="UI to add curves from different events"/>
						<p>Previously, in an XY Chart, the user was only able to add curves that arose from a single <span class="lookup-word">event</span>. This restriction was removed, and the user is now able to add curves from multiple <span class="lookup-word">events</span> into a single XY Chart.</p>
						<p>There are two modes for adding curves (highlighted in the image above):</p>
						<ul class="detail-section-list">
							<li>‘Replace’ mode
								<ul>
									<li>This was the only mode that was previously supported. Whenever the user creates a new curve, it would replace the existing one. This is useful for quickly visualizing a curve from the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> without cluttering the XY Chart.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>‘Accumulate’ mode
								<ul>
									<li>This is a new mode that I added. Typically, a user would create a curve from the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> from one <span class="lookup-word">event</span>, then add another curve from the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> from another <span class="lookup-word">event</span>. With the ‘Replace’ mode, the first curve would be replaced by the second curve, whereas with the ‘Accumulate’ mode, both curves will be shown, allowing users to ‘accumulate’ curves from different <span class="lookup-word">events</span>.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 2 - Display result data in a 3D graphics or XY Chart viewport</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/10.png" alt="Context menu for displaying a 3D or XY chart"/>
						<p>The user can display the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> either in a 3D graphics <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> or an XY Chart <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> by right-clicking on an <span class="lookup-word">event</span> and selecting an option.</p>
						<p>When the user selects an option, the system creates a new <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> that displays the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 3 - Synchronized animation</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/16.gif" alt="GIF showing synchronous animation"/>
						<p>The user can play animation across multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>. The animation is time-synchronized. This allows the user to observe how the model behaves at spots that standout (e.g. dips or pointy parts in the chart).</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 4 - Couple viewports</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/11.png" alt="coupled viewports"/>
						<p>The user can turn <span class="lookup-word">coupling</span> ON or OFF. When <span class="lookup-word">coupling</span> is on, <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span> that are displaying the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> from the same <span class="lookup-word">event</span> are considered <span class="lookup-word">coupled</span> and will have the same colored icon. When the user changes the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> being displayed in one of the <span class="lookup-word">coupled</span> <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>, it will be updated in all of the <span class="lookup-word">coupled</span> <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>. If <span class="lookup-word">coupling</span> is turned OFF, then changing the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span> will only affect the active <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 5 - Toggle viewport type</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/12.png" alt="UI to toggle viewports"/>
						<p>For each <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span>, the user can choose to display the 3D graphics view or chart view of the <span class="lookup-word">result data</span>. </p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 6 - Maximize a viewport</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/13.png" alt="Maximized viewport"/>
						<p>The user can maximize a single <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> to isolate and focus on a particular <span class="lookup-word">result plot</span>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 7 - Change viewport layout</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/14.png" alt="UI to change viewport layout"/>
						<p>The user can change the <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> layout (e.g. 3 views on top, 2 views on the bottom; 2 views on top, 3 views on the bottom) and resize <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>.</p>
					</section>
					<section class="detail-subsection">
						<h3 class="detail-subsection-title">KEY FEATURE 8 - Create multiple collections of viewports</h3>
						<img class="detail-section-img" src="images/multi/15.png" alt="tabs for different viewport collections"/>
						<p>The user can create multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport collections</span>, which can hold up to 9 <span class="lookup-word">viewports</span>. A typical workflow would be displaying different types of simulation in each <span class="lookup-word">viewport collection</span>.</p>

					<h2 class="detail-section-title">Outcomes And Impacts</h2>
					<p>The multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> capability is used by all of Apex’s customers. It has increased the usability in <span class="lookup-word">post-processing</span> considerably by allowing users to easily compare <span class="lookup-word">result plots</span> side by side, saving a significant amount of time in their workflow. An Application Engineer reported feedback from a user that this feature has saved them about 100 hours in each project.</p>
					<p>Additionally, supporting the multiple <span class="lookup-word">viewport</span> capabilities in Apex helped us extend our contract with Honda.</p>
